==================================================

ipforensics is a network administration utility that uses network packet capture to passively determine the Internet Protocol versions used by the devices on your local network segment: IPv4, IPv6, or both.  If you're planning an IPv6 migration, this utility will tell you which devices need to be moved over.

Supported Platforms
-------------------

ipforensics is expected to run on Linux, Mac OS X, UNIX and Windows

Status
------

ipforensics compiles and runs under Mac OS X 10.9.1. Linux testing is next.
