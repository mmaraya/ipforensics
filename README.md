==================================================

ipforensics is a network administration utility that uses network packet capture to passively determine the Internet Protocol versions used by the devices on your local network segment: IPv4, IPv6, or both.  If you're planning an IPv6 migration, this utility will tell you which devices need to be moved over.

Supported Platforms
-------------------

ipforensics runs on Linux and Mac OS X. Support for UNIX and Windows is in progress.

Status
------

ipforensics compiles and runs under Mac OS X 10.9.1 and Linux with gcc 4.8 or higher.  It is dependent on libpcap-dev.
